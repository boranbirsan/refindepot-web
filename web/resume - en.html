                            Considering that there is a need for a CV at every stage of life, 
                            the availability of a "Basic CV" with standard content and its updating over time allows many opportunities in academic and professional scope to be evaluated. 
                            This basic curriculum vitae, which was prepared in advance, 
                            should be revised by considering the purpose of use and the institution to be used during the application, 
                            from the perspective of the person in the institution to which it will be applied.

                                    <p>There is no such thing as "absolutely correct" when preparing a resume. It is possible to come across many different resume patterns when researched on the Internet. The “accurate” resume pattern is the expectation of the institution to which you will present the resume. If the institution does not expect a specific format from you, you can act more freely and use any format you want. However, it is important to use the CV format included in the career pages of Harvard University for academic applications made to certain countries, and the European Union CV format called European Format for applications made to universities of some European countries. More detailed information is available on our portal with examples.</p>

                                    <p><span>Latin origin CV “Curriculum Vitae” is used in the same context as French Resume in many countries, but it differs significantly, especially in the USA and Canada (excluding Quebec Region). In these countries, CV is a definition used mostly for academic purposes and it means a more detailed resume. A "Resume" is usually expected to be 1, or 2 pages in the maximum. On the other hand, "CV" is usually 2 pages but, can also be more. Especially, CVs of people with a long academic career can reach up to five or six pages since they include all of their academic publications as well.</span></p>
                                    <p><span>Therefore, the document used in undergraduate applications in North America is ‘Resume’. The document used in graduate applications is a CV or Resume according to the program applied for. The document used in business life is a Resume unless the application is for a high-level professional position or an academic post. The important thing here is not what we call the document. Since the receiver knows very well what the document is prepared for, there is no need to add a title in the form of CV or Resume. The important thing is to take CV writing rules into account while preparing a CV, and Resume writing rules when preparing a resume. These two definitions can be used interchangeably in many countries except America and Canada and in the Canadian province of Quebec. So outside of North America (excluding Quebec), we can say; CV = Resume.</span></p>

                                        Almost all professional and academic resources state the requirement of a cover letter along with the CV when making an application. In our opinion, the most important point in the presentation of the cover page is what purpose this page will serve and what other documents are presented with this page. 
                                        <br><br> 
                                        In job and internship applications, the cover page is an important document accompanying the resume. Researches; It shows that a complementary cover letter addressed to the institution, together with the CV, is viewed positively by the human resources departments. Cover letter (Cover Letter) used to apply for academic/professional positions supports your eligibility for the position applied for and is both a presentation tool and space restrictions on your resume, etc. It undertakes the task of a document in which you cannot detail because of it and which you will include details about the position applied for. When writing the cover page (Crossword), it is recommended to include tangible evidence that can prove what you can contribute to the job, rather than emphasizing how much you want the job. It is necessary to avoid clichés and exaggerations in my writing, and to avoid listing qualities and abilities that are not supported by confirming examples. 
                                        <br><br> 
                                        In some academic applications in Europe, a motivation letter is not required together with the resume, but only a cover letter. In this case, this cover page acts as a motivation letter. The reason why we make these elaborations is the confusion of concepts between the expressions “motivation letter”, “statement of purpose”, “cover letter” and “personal statement” from time to time. The success of an application is linked to a good understanding of what is meant by the specified document. The correct document is the document within the scope requested by the institution applied for. The same document may have been used in another context in another institution. The important thing is what the institution applied for wants. Detailed information about these concepts and examples of the cover page (cover letter) in various academic sources are given on our portal.
